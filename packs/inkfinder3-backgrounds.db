One must be to <strong>Intelligence</strong> or <strong>Wisdom</strong> and the other is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You become trained in your choice of Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion .

Once per day when you use @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.uR62fVC9FyQAMCO1]{Trick Magic Item}, you can choose to roll twice and take the higher result; this is a fortune effect.
